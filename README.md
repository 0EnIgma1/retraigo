### Postulates of NeTT

*- That time NeTT felt like a sage*

* If you have an opinion, share it or keep it to yourself. Don't force it on others.

* If you have a personal belief, let it be religious or ethical, keep it to yourself. Don't force it on others.

* If you have a personal problem with someone, keep it personal. Bringing it to unrelated online platforms wouldn't give you justice.

* If you need help with something, describe what you need help with instead of asking if you can get help without describing the matter. 

* If someone asks for help and you don't want to help them, don't help them. Instead, don't blame their ignorance on the matter.

* If someone doesn't like something, don't do it just to piss them off. 

* If someone starts complaining about everything for no reason, just don't mind them. There is no cure for stupidity.

* If someone doesn't like scary stuff, keep scary stuff away from them. Especially NeTT.
